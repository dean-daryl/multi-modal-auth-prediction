Product Recommendation System Project
Project Overview
This project focuses on building a Product Recommendation System from raw data to a fully functional recommendation engine.
The system is designed to:

Clean and preprocess data.

Store processed datasets in .pkl files for efficiency.

Provide product recommendations based on similarity metrics.

Automate dataset generation if real-world data is missing (for testing).

Objectives
Build a reusable data pipeline that can handle missing values, normalization, and feature preparation.

Use pickle files (.pkl) to save processed datasets for faster loading.

Implement a recommendation function that retrieves top similar products.

Create a large dummy dataset when actual product data is unavailable.

Demonstrate a realistic recommendation scenario with a clean codebase and modular design.

Core Components
1. Data Handling
Load and explore product data from CSV, database, or synthetic generation.

Handle missing values:

Fill categorical values with "Unknown".

Fill numerical values with median values.

Normalize numerical features (e.g., prices, ratings).
2.  Recommendation Engine
Approach:

Use TF-IDF vectorization of product names.

Compute cosine similarity to find similar products.

Future Improvements
Implement collaborative filtering and content-based hybrid models.

Integrate with a web application (Flask or Django).

Add user-product interaction data for personalized recommendations.
